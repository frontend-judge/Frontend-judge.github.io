  <h1>Interesting Websites I’ve Explored</h1>

  <p>
    I enjoy exploring lesser-known corners of the web out of curiosity. Recently, I spent some time browsing the modern v3 version of the Hidden Wiki, and I have to say, it’s surprisingly well-organized and easy to navigate.

  <p>
    What I liked most is that it focuses on Tor v3 links and keeps everything neatly categorized. Unlike older versions I’ve seen, you don’t have to dig through messy pages to find what you’re looking for. The site is tidy, efficient, and really user-friendly.

  <p>
    There’s a huge variety of links available, covering everything from AI tools, email hosting, and website hosting, to crypto resources, video games, movies, and even some adult content. Basically, if it’s not on the standard web, you’re likely to find it here. And it’s all sorted so you can find what you need quickly.

    I’m keeping this page as a personal reference list of interesting sites I’ve explored. Overall, the v3 Hidden Wiki is a solid resource for anyone curious about what’s out there beyond the surface web.
